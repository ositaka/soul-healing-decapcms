Distant healing occurs when the healer and client are physically together or videocal but with no physical touch. The healing is achieved through thought and prayer. The healer usually sits beside or behind the client, respecting their comfort, allowing healing energies to flow from the Divine Source. This process follows the natural law: setting the intention for healing leads to taking action for healing.
