"Distance healing is a profound approach to healing that acknowledges the interconnectedness of energy and intention. In distance healing, the practitioner and the recipient are often separated by physical distance. Through the power of intention, focused energy, and the mind-body connection, the healer channels healing energy to the recipient, irrespective of their location. This practice transcends the confines of time and space, allowing the healer to induce a healing trance state, promote emotional and physical well-being, and support the client's healing journey.

Distance healing is a testament to the boundless potential of the human mind and spirit, affirming that healing can be accessible to anyone, regardless of where they are in the world. It underscores the influence of intention and energy in the healing process, offering hope, comfort, and support to those seeking healing, no matter the miles that separate them from the healer."
