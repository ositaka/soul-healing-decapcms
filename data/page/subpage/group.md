Distant healing is a holistic practice focused on sending healing energy or intention to patients who are not physically present. It supports their well-being, addressing physical, emotional, and spiritual concerns from a distance. When conducted via telephone, Skype, or Zoom, it establishes a direct connection between Tiago and the recipient. The session commences with a conversation, followed by a relaxation period. Then, Tiago aligns with healing energies and initiates the formal healing process. The session often concludes with additional conversation.
