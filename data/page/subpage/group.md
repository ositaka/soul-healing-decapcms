Distance healing, similar to absent healing, allows healing without the client and healer being in the same place. In distance healing:

Healing happens even when the healer and client are far apart. Through focused intention, energy, and the mind-body connection, the healer sends healing energy to the client, no matter where they are. Distance healing transcends time and space, promoting emotional and physical well-being. It's a powerful reminder of the potential of the human spirit, making healing accessible to anyone, no matter where they are.

In this case, distance healing occurs when the healer and client are physically together or videocal but with no physical touch. The healing is achieved through thought and prayer. The healer usually sits beside or behind the client, respecting their comfort, allowing healing energies to flow from the Divine Source. This process follows the natural law: setting the intention for healing leads to taking action for healing.
