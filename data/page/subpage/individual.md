Also called in-person healing, involves Tiago providing hands-on or direct healing energy to the patient in their immediate physical presence. It's an intimate form of healing with direct interaction, often incorporating touch and energy work. Tiago creates a calming environment, induces a trance state, and offers emotional, physical, and spiritual support. This approach allows for immediate feedback, strengthening the connection between him and the patient. Touch and hands-on techniques are commonly used, emphasizing the importance of human connection in a direct and personal healing experience.
