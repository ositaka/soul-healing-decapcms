Arrange a serene, uncluttered area where you can fully relax. Consider using soft lighting, playing soothing music, or lighting incense to create an inviting atmosphere.

Take a moment to reflect on your aspirations for the trance healing session. Whether you seek physical healing, emotional release, or spiritual growth, having well-defined intentions will serve as your guiding light.

Before the session, hydrate by drinking a glass of water. This not only fosters grounding but also ensures the smooth flow of energy during your healing journey.

Opt for loose, comfortable clothing that allows for ease of movement and minimizes physical discomfort.

Silence or power down your electronic devices to create a distraction-free environment. Ensure you won't be interrupted during this sacred time.

Prior to the session, take a few moments to center your being. Engage in a brief meditation or deep breathing exercises to calm your mind and prepare for the transformative healing experience.

If you share your space, communicate with others about your session and kindly request privacy and uninterrupted time.

Set the intention to release mental distractions and daily concerns during the session. Create mental boundaries that enable you to focus solely on your healing journey.

Approach the session with an open heart and an open mind. Trust the process and the guidance of your healing practitioner, as your receptivity can enhance the experience.

Have a notebook and pen within reach for post-session reflections and to capture any valuable insights that may arise during or after the session.

If you have any questions or concerns about the session, do not hesitate to discuss them with the healing practitioner. Clarifying your expectations will contribute to a smooth and fruitful experience.
