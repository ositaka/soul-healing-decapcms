"Present healing is a deeply personal and tangible form of healing that unfolds with the healer and recipient in the same physical space. In this setting, the healer engages with the client through direct interaction, often using touch, energy work, and various healing techniques. The practitioner creates a calming and healing environment, inducing a trance state, and offering emotional, physical, and spiritual support.

Present healing allows for immediate feedback, creating an intimate connection between the healer and the client. The use of physical modalities, such as touch or hands-on healing, is a common feature of present healing, facilitating an immediate and interactive healing experience. This form of healing emphasizes the power of the human connection, making it an ideal choice for those who seek hands-on guidance and a direct, personal healing journey."
