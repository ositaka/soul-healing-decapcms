## **Embarking on an One-on-One Golden Healing Journey**

Envision embarking on a personal journey where the golden healing light involves your body and spirit:

You and Tiago meet in a serene setting, ready to set sail on this extraordinary healing journey. If you wish, you openly share your feelings and hopes for healing.

As you settle into your comfortable space, Tiago taps into the Divine Intelligence of healing energy through an alternate state of consciousness, softly placing their hands on your head or near you. The golden light flows through and a warm, golden radiance envelops you, cradling you like a gentle sunbeam. 

The golden light washes over you, tenderly comforting and revitalizing your body and soul. You're wrapped in a sense of tranquility and ease, like a familiar, comforting embrace.

Within this radiant cocoon, a profound sense of peace may wash over you, as if your worries are melting away, leaving behind a tranquil serenity.

As the session nears its end, you and Tiago exchange thoughts and feelings about your journey. If you wish, you communicate your sensations, emotions, and newfound clarity.

Depending on your needs, this healing voyage may extend through future sessions, allowing you to immerse yourself further in the golden light's healing embrace.

While golden healing provides a nurturing path, it's meant to complement, not replace, medical care for serious health concerns. For those matters, consulting a healthcare professional is essential.
