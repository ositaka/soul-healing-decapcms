Absent healing is a practice where Tiago and the patient can be in different locations. By combining thought, prayer, and intention, he connects with the spirit world to send healing energy to the patient, regardless of their physical whereabouts. The patient's awareness of this process is not necessary for it to be effective. Establishing a personal connection can be helpful but isn't essential. Spiritual attunement, like "sitting in the power," is vital for all types of Spiritualist healing, including absent healing. This method transcends time and space, offering healing to anyone, no matter where they are.
