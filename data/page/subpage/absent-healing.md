"In the realm of healing, absent healing is a profound and compassionate practice that defies the constraints of distance. In this mode of healing, the practitioner extends their healing intentions, energy, and focus to those who may be far away or unable to be physically present. Through the power of intention and energy transfer, the healer connects with the recipient's energy field, often facilitated by a photograph, name, or other personal identifier. This distant connection allows the healer to induce a healing trance state, release emotional or physical burdens, and promote well-being.

Absent healing is a testament to the interconnectedness of all living beings, demonstrating that healing energy can traverse space and time to reach those in need. It offers comfort, support, and healing to individuals who may be unable to attend an in-person session, highlighting the remarkable capabilities of intention and energy in the realm of healing."
