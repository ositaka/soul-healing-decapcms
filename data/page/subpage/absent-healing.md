Absent healing occurs when the healer and the patient are in different locations. The healer combines thought and prayer to connect with the healers in the spirit world and send healing energy to the patient, regardless of their whereabouts. Some healers keep patient lists, while others use a general approach, praying for collective healing without specific names.

The key is the healer's intention to connect with the spirit world. Absent healing is effective, even if the patient is unaware of it. Establishing a personal connection, such as through a letter or mutual acquaintance, can be helpful but isn't essential. Spiritual attunement, like "sitting in the power," is vital for all types of Spiritualist healing, including absent healing.

The aim is to find an approach that suits each person without causing stress. Absent healing is a valuable option for patients unable to receive in-person healing and provides reassurance that someone cares for their well-being, regardless of their location.
