      **Unique Connection with the Spirit World**


      Through years of devotion, Tiago has cultivated a special relationship with spirit controls—those benevolent guides who assist him in this work. This bond allows for a sharper, more precise flow of healing power, tailored to your unique needs. Whether wounds are of the body, heart, mind, or spirit, the energy flows where it is most needed, guided by a wisdom far greater than Tiago's own.

      **No Words Needed, Only Presence**


      One of the gifts of Trance Healing is it’s gentle, non-intrusive nature. You need not speak of your medical conditions or the reasons you seek healing, though in this healing, Tiago hold space for sharing if you feel called to do so. The energy listens to the silent language of your soul, finding its way to where it can serve you best. After the session, if you wish to share it discuss your experience, he is here to listen with open heart-but the choice is always yours.
