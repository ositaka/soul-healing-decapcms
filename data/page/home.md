      Beloved Souls gathered here in this circle of healing, I am Tiago Araújo,
      your guide into the realm of Trance Healing. As we come together in this
      sacred space, I feel the gentle presence of our Spirit Guides, ready to
      envelop us in their divine light and grace.




      What is Trance Healing?


      Trance Healing is a profound and sacred practice, a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms. In this space, I enter an altered state of consciousness, surrendering myself as a vessel to channel healing energies from God through the loving guidance of my Spirit Guides. This is not just a technique—it is a dance of trust and connection, a blending of energies that allows the spirit world to work through me to bring forth healing that touches the deepest parts of your being.




      A Unique Connection with the Spirit World


      Through years of devotion, I have cultivated a special relationship with my spirit controls—those benevolent guides who assist me in this work. This bond allows for a sharper, more precise flow of healing power, tailored to your unique needs. Whether your wounds are of the body, heart, mind, or spirit, the energy flows where it is most needed, guided by a wisdom far greater than my own.




      No Words Needed, Only Presence


      One of the gifts of Trance Healing is its gentle, non-intrusive nature. You need not speak of your medical conditions or the reasons you seek healing, though in this circle, we hold space for sharing if you feel called to do so. The energy listens to the silent language of your soul, finding its way to where it can serve you best. After our session, if you wish to share or discuss your experience, we are here to listen with open hearts—but the choice is always yours.

       A Space of Possibility, Not Promises

      Many have found solace, transformation, and renewal through Trance Healing in our circle, yet I must humbly acknowledge that each journey is unique. While the spirit world offers boundless love and possibility, I make no promises of specific outcomes. This practice is a companion to your well-being, not a replacement for professional medical care, and I always encourage you to seek medical advice when needed.




      An Invitation to Receive


      Here, in this healing circle, we create a sanctuary of peace and support. Trance Healing blends beautifully with the collective energy we generate together—through our shared intentions, our breaths, and our open hearts. In this sacred hour, I invite you to simply be present. Feel the connection with those around you, and open your heart to the infinite love that surrounds us. Allow the energies of the spirit world to flow through you, to uplift and restore you in ways that words cannot fully capture.

      Let Us Begin


      As we prepare to step into this sacred space together, I ask you to close your eyes and let go of any burdens you may carry. Trust in the unseen, trust in the process, and trust in the loving support of this circle. Together, let us welcome the presence of the spirit world and embrace the great energy of spiritual healing that awaits us.




      With all my love and gratitude,  


      Tiago Araújo
