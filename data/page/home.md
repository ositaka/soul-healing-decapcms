      name: "Healing Hour "
    text: Trance Healing is a profound and sacred practice, acting as a bridge
      between the physical and spiritual realms. Tiago enters an altered state
      of consciousness, surrendering as a vessel to channel healing energies
      from the Divine Intelligence through the loving guidance of Spirit Guides.
      This practice is not merely a technique but a dance of trust and
      connection, blending energies that allow the spirit world to work through
      Tiago, bringing forth healing that touches the deepest parts of one's
      being.

      name: A Unique Connection with the Spirit World
    text: Through years of devotion, Tiago has cultivated a special relationship
      with spirit controls—benevolent guides assisting in this work. This bond
      allows for a sharper, more precise flow of healing power, tailored to each
      individual's unique needs. Whether wounds are of the body, heart, mind, or
      spirit, the energy flows where it is most needed, guided by a wisdom far
      greater than Tiago's own.

      name: A Space of Possibility, Not Promise
    text: Many have found solace, transformation, and renewal through Trance
      Healing, yet Tiago humbly acknowledges that each journey is unique. While
      the spirit world offers boundless love and possibility, Tiago makes no
      promises of specific outcomes. This practice is a companion to well-being,
      not a replacement for professional medical care, and Tiago always
      encourages seeking medical advice when needed.

      Healing blends beautifully with the collective energy generated
      together—through shared intentions, breaths, and open hearts. Tiago
      invites everyone to simply be present, feel the connection with those
      around them, and open their hearts to the infinite love that surrounds
      them. The energies of the spirit world flow through attendees, uplifting
      and restoring them in ways that words cannot fully capture.

    text: As preparation to step into this sacred space begins, Tiago asks everyone
      to close their eyes and let go of any burdens they may carry. Trust in the
      unseen, trust in the process, and trust in the loving support of the
      circle. Together, all are welcomed into the presence of the spirit world
      to embrace the great energy of spiritual healing that awaits.
