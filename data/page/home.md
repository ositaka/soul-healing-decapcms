      Tiago is very good in presence and distance healing sessions. He taught me
      the Trance Healing. Which forever transformed certain aspects of my life.
      It has a specific signature and makes the energy tangible. It is one of
      the important encounters of my life. He will guide you with respect and
      compassion. Highly recommended.

      The healing sessions I have received have been powerful. I felt super relaxed and held during each session, and they clearly opened up my system, opened up my heart and infused me with a lot of light. Tiago uses a technique that goes to the core of healing. So using himself as a vessel, he was able to bring me to my essence. It is subtle, but powerful. And Tiago is a wonderful facilitator!
