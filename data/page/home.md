    text: Trance Healing is gentle and non-intrusive. There is no need to share your
      reasons for seeking healing, though Tiago holds a compassionate space for
      your voice if you choose to speak. The energy listens to your soul’s
      silent call, flowing where it is needed most. After the session, Tiago
      remains present to listen with an open heart if you wish to share, but the
      choice is always yours.

    text: Trance Healing is gentle, respectful, and never intrusive. You don’t need
      to say why you’re here—the energy naturally finds its way to where your
      soul needs support. If you’d like to share your thoughts or feelings,
      Tiago is there to listen with kindness, but it’s entirely up to you. After
      the session, you’re welcome to talk if you wish, knowing this is a safe
      and caring space.

    text: Tiago has spent years practicing a deep connection with his Spirit Guides,
      who guide this healing work with love and wisdom. In a session, he enters
      a trance state, allowing these guides to direct healing energy exactly
      where it’s needed—perhaps to ease your body, soothe your heart, clear your
      mind, or lift your spirit. Their gentle precision ensures the energy flows
      with care to you.

    text: Many people feel comfort, relaxation, or a fresh sense of balance after
      Trance Healing, though everyone’s experience is different. Tiago respects
      your unique journey and doesn’t promise specific outcomes. This practice
      is here to support your well-being, not to take the place of medical care.
      Tiago encourages you to seek professional medical advice when needed, as
      Trance Healing is a complementary path, working alongside traditional
      healthcare.
