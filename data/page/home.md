      Beloved Souls gathered in this circle of healing, you are guided by Tiago
      Araújo, who leads you into the realm of Trance Healing. In this sacred
      space, Tiago feels the gentle presence of Spirit Guides, ready to envelop
      everyone in their divine light and grace.




      What is Trance Healing?


      Trance Healing is a profound and sacred practice, acting as a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms. Tiago enters an altered state of consciousness, surrendering as a vessel to channel healing energies from God through the loving guidance of Spirit Guides. This practice is not merely a technique but a dance of trust and connection, blending energies that allow the spirit world to work through Tiago, bringing forth healing that touches the deepest parts of one's being.




      A Unique Connection with the Spirit World


      Through years of devotion, Tiago has cultivated a special relationship with spirit controls—benevolent guides assisting in this work. This bond allows for a sharper, more precise flow of healing power, tailored to each individual's unique needs. Whether wounds are of the body, heart, mind, or spirit, the energy flows where it is most needed, guided by a wisdom far greater than Tiago's own.




      No Words Needed, Only Presence


      One of the gifts of Trance Healing is its gentle, non-intrusive nature. There is no need to speak of medical conditions or the reasons for seeking healing, though the circle holds space for sharing if one feels called to do so. The energy listens to the silent language of the soul, finding its way to serve best. After the session, Tiago is there to listen with an open heart if one wishes to share or discuss their experience—but the choice is always yours.




      A Space of Possibility, Not Promises


      Many have found solace, transformation, and renewal through Trance Healing in this circle, yet Tiago humbly acknowledges that each journey is unique. While the spirit world offers boundless love and possibility, Tiago makes no promises of specific outcomes. This practice is a companion to well-being, not a replacement for professional medical care, and Tiago always encourages seeking medical advice when needed.




      An Invitation to Receive


      In this healing circle, a sanctuary of peace and support is created. Trance Healing blends beautifully with the collective energy generated together—through shared intentions, breaths, and open hearts. Tiago invites everyone to simply be present, feel the connection with those around them, and open their hearts to the infinite love that surrounds them. The energies of the spirit world flow through attendees, uplifting and restoring them in ways that words cannot fully capture.




      Let Us Begin


      As preparation to step into this sacred space begins, Tiago asks everyone to close their eyes and let go of any burdens they may carry. Trust in the unseen, trust in the process, and trust in the loving support of the circle. Together, all are welcomed into the presence of the spirit world to embrace the great energy of spiritual healing that awaits.


      With all his love and gratitude,


      Tiago Araújo
