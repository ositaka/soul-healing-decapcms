      Tiago is very good in presence and distance healing sessions. He taught me
      the Trance Healing. Which forever transformed certain aspects of my life.
      It has a specific signature and makes the energy tangible. It is one of
      the important encounters of my life. He will guide you with respect and
      compassion. Highly recommended.
