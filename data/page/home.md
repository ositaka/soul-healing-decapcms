      name: What is Trance Healing
    text: Trance Healing is a profound and sacred practice, a bridge between the
      physical and spiritual realms. In this space, Tiago enters an altered
      state of consciousness, surrendering as a vessel to channel healing
      energies from the Divine Intelligence through the loving guidance of
      Spirit Guides. This practice is not merely a technique but a dance of
      trust and connection, a blending energies that allows the spirit world to
      work through Tiago to bring forth healing that touches the deepest parts
      of your being.

    text: Through years of devotion, Tiago has cultivated a special relationship
      with spirit controls—those benevolent guides who assist him in this work.
      This bond allows for a sharper, more precise flow of healing power,
      tailored to your unique needs. Whether wounds are of the body, heart,
      mind, or spirit, the energy flows where it is most needed, guided by a
      wisdom far greater than Tiago's own.
