      - title: Distant
        text: Distant healing, also known as remote healing, is a holistic practice
          where healing energy or intention is sent to an individual who is not
          physically present. This method transcends physical boundaries and
          aims to promote the recipient's well-being, addressing physical,
          emotional, or spiritual concerns, even from afar. Distant healing
          harnesses the power of intention and the interconnectedness of mind,
          body, and spirit to facilitate healing and balance.

      - title: Absent
        text: Absent healing sends energy from a distance to promote well-being in
          individuals not physically present. It transcends geographical
          boundaries, demonstrating the power of intention, energy, and
          mind-body-spirit connections in the healing process.

      Spiritual healing is like embarking on a journey for your mind, body, and
      soul. It reduces stress, soothes your emotions, and helps your body heal.
      It also clears your thoughts, making you more confident and emotionally
      strong.


      It balances your energy, boosting your self-esteem and promoting spiritual growth. It's a safe place to heal from past struggles and enjoy better sleep. Your instincts improve, and you become more self-assured, helping you manage anxiety.


      Letting go of negative thoughts and limiting beliefs leads to personal growth. You'll find relief from pain and experience a surge of creativity. The healing aligns you with your soul's purpose, enhances your intuition, and makes you more aware. It brings a sense of lightness, ease, and positive changes to your life, making your mind and body work together harmoniously.

      - testimonial: The healing sessions I have received have been powerful. I felt
          super relaxed and held during each session, and they clearly opened up
          my system, opened up my heart and infused me with a lot of light.
          Tiago uses a technique that goes to the core of healing. So using
          himself as a vessel, he was able to bring me to my essence. It is
          subtle, but powerful. And Tiago is a wonderful facilitator!
