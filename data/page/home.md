      **What is Trance Healing?**


      Trance Healing is a profound and sacred practice, serving as a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms. In this space, Tiago enters an altered state of consciousness, surrendering as a vessel to channel healing energies from the Divine Intelligence through the guidance of the Spirit Guides. This is a dance of trust and connection, a blending of energies that allows the spirit world to work through Tiago to bring forth healing that touches the deepest parts of your being.


      **A Unique Connection with the Spirit World**


      Through years of practice, Tiago has cultivated a special connection with the spirit guides who assist in this sacred work. This bond enables a sharper, more precise flow of healing power to your unique needs. Whether your wounds are of the body, heart, mind, or spirit, the energy flows where it is most needed, guided by a wisdom far greater than Tiago’s own.

      **No Words Needed, Only Presence**


      One of the gifts of Trance Healing is its gentle, non-intrusive nature. You need not speak of your medical conditions or reasons for seeking healing, though space is held for sharing if you feel called to do so. The energy listens to the silent language of your soul, finding its way to where it can serve best. After a session, if you wish to share or discuss your experience, Tiago is there to listen with an open heart—but the choice always remains yours.


      **A Space of Possibility, Not Promises**


      Many have found solace, transformation, and renewal through Trance Healing with Tiago, yet he humbly acknowledges that each journey is unique. While the spirit world offers boundless love and possibility, Tiago makes no promises of specific outcomes. This practice serves as a companion to well-being, not a replacement for professional medical care, and Tiago always encourages you to seek medical advice when needed.

      **An Invitation to Receive**


      In this sacred space, a sanctuary of peace and support is created. Trance Healing blends beautifully with the energy generated through shared intentions, breaths, and an open heart. In this sacred hour, Tiago invites you to be present and to open your heart to the infinite love that surrounds you. The energies of the spirit world are invited to flow through you, uplifting and restoring in ways that words cannot fully capture.



      **Join the Healing**


      As you prepare to step into this sacred space, Tiago encourages you to close your eyes and release any burdens you may carry. Trust in the unseen, trust in the process, and trust in the loving support of this moment. You are invited to welcome the presence of the spirit world and embrace the radiant energy of spiritual healing that awaits.



      With Love and Gratitude,  


      Tiago Araújo
