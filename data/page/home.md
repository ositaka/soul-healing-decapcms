      Spiritual healing is like embarking on a journey for your mind, body, and
      soul. It reduces stress, soothes your emotions, and helps your body heal.
      It also clears your thoughts, making you more confident and emotionally
      strong.


      It balances your energy, boosting your self-esteem and promoting spiritual growth. It's a safe place to heal from past struggles and enjoy better sleep. Your instincts improve, and you become more self-assured, helping you manage anxiety.


      Letting go of negative thoughts and limiting beliefs leads to personal growth. You'll find relief from pain and experience a surge of creativity. The healing aligns you with your soul's purpose, enhances your intuition, and makes you more aware. It brings a sense of lightness, ease, and positive changes to your life, making your mind and body work together harmoniously.

      - testimonial: Tiago is very good in presence and distance healing sessions. He
          taught me the Trance Healing. Which forever transformed certain

      - testimonial: The healing sessions I have received have been powerful. I felt
          super relaxed and held during each session, and they clearly opened up
          my system, opened up my heart and infused me with a lot of light.
          Tiago uses a technique that goes to the core of healing. So using
          himself as a vessel, he was able to bring me to my essence. It is
          subtle, but powerful. And Tiago is a wonderful facilitator!
