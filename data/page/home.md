    text: Welcome to this calm dimension where the physical and spiritual bodies
      come together to evolve and glow. Here, you embody the light of your soul
      and the spark of your essence. Your heart opens, the light enters and you
      anchor into the present time-line of existence.

      name: What is Trance Healing?
    text: >-
      Trance Healing is a practice with ancient roots in mediumship. \

      During the session and through an alternate state of consciousness, Tiago enters a trance state to be the conduit of Divine Intelligence that guides the flow of energy to where is needed the most: physical comfort, emotional peace, mental clarity, or spiritual renewal. \

      It’s a holistic experience that can move on many levels at once and can be offered in person or at a distance and can be facilitated individually or in a group setting.

      • **In-person** — We meet in a physical place. \

      The presence often allows the energy to be felt deeper - many experience warmth, tingling, or a profound sense of connection.


      • **At a Distance** — We connect through Zoom or a similar platform. \

      The energy flows with the same strength and precision, clear intention and presence.


      • **Absent (no call required)** — You rest quietly in your own space at the agreed time. \

      The energy arrives through your permission and openness - many people find this way intimate and deeply restorative.


      **Individual Sessions or Circles of Light**


      You may choose a private individual session, where the focus is on your unique journey, or join a Circle of Light - a group (in-person or online) where the shared intention amplifies the field of love and light. \

      In both, the energy is directed with precision and unconditional care.

    text: You don’t need to say why you’re here. The energy naturally finds its way
      to where your soul needs support. If you’d like to share your thoughts or
      feelings, Tiago is there to listen with kindness, but it’s entirely up to
      you. After the session, you’re welcome to talk if you wish, knowing this
      is a safe and caring space.

    text: Tiago respects your unique journey and doesn’t promise specific outcomes.
      This practice is here to support your well-being, not to take the place of
      medical care. He encourages you to seek professional medical advice when
      needed, as Trance Healing is a complementary therapy, working alongside
      traditional healthcare.
