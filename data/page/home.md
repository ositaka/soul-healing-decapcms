      name: What is Trance Healing?
    text: Trance Healing is a gentle and non-intrusive spiritual practice with roots
      in ancient traditions and mediumship. During a session, the healer enters
      a trance state, becoming a bridge for divine energy from the spirit world.
      Guided by Spirit Guides, this energy flows to where you need it
      most—physical comfort, emotional peace, mental clarity, or spiritual
      renewal. It’s a holistic experience that can work on many levels at once
      and can be offered in-person or from a distance and can be done
      individually or in a group as a Healing Circle.

    text: You don’t need to say why you’re here—the energy naturally finds its way
      to where your soul needs support. If you’d like to share your thoughts or
      feelings, Tiago is there to listen with kindness, but it’s entirely up to
      you. After the session, you’re welcome to talk if you wish, knowing this
      is a safe and caring space.

    text: Tiago has spent years practicing a connection with his Spirit Guides, who
      guide this healing work with love and wisdom. In a session, he enters a
      trance state, allowing these guides to direct healing energy exactly where
      it’s needed—perhaps to ease your body, soothe your heart, clear your mind,
      or lift your spirit. Their gentle precision ensures the energy flows with
      care to you.

    text: Many people feel comfort, relaxation, or a fresh sense of balance after a
      session, though everyone’s experience is different. Tiago respects your
      unique journey and doesn’t promise specific outcomes. This practice is
      here to support your well-being, not to take the place of medical care. He
      encourages you to seek professional medical advice when needed, as Trance
      Healing is a complementary path, working alongside traditional healthcare.
