      - testimonial: Tiago is very good in presence and distance healing sessions. He
          taught me the Trance Healing. Which forever transformed certain
          aspects of my life. It has a specific signature and makes the energy
          tangible. It is one of the important encounters of my life. He will
          guide you with respect and compassion. Highly recommended.

      - testimonial: The healing sessions I have received have been powerful. I felt
          super relaxed and held during each session, and they clearly opened up
          my system, opened up my heart and infused me with a lot of light.
          Tiago uses a technique that goes to the core of healing. So using
          himself as a vessel, he was able to bring me to my essence. It is
          subtle, but powerful. And Tiago is a wonderful facilitator!
