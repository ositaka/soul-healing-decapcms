    text: Trance Healing is a profound and sacred practice, a bridge between the
      physical and spiritual realms. In this space, Tiago enters an altered
      state of consciousness, surrendering as a vessel to channel healing
      energies from the Divine Intelligence through the loving guidance of
      Spirit Guides. This practice is not merely a technique but a dance of
      trust and connection, a blending energies that allows the spirit world to
      work through Tiago to bring forth healing that touches the deepest parts
      of your being.

      with spirit healers—those benevolent guides who assist him in this work.

      tailored to your unique needs. Whether wounds are of the body, heart,
      mind, or spirit, the energy flows where it is most needed, guided by a
      wisdom far greater than Tiago's own.

      healing, though in this healing, Tiago hold space for sharing if you feel
      called to do so. The energy listens to the silent language of your soul,
      finding its way to where it can serve you best. After the session, if you
      wish to share it discuss your experience, he is here to listen with open
      heart-but the choice is always yours.
