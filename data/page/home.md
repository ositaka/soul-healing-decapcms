      Trance Healing is a profound and sacred practice, a bridge between the
      physical and spiritual realms. In this space, Tiago enters an altered
      state of consciousness, surrendering as a vessel to channel healing
      energies from the Divine Intelligence through the loving guidance of
      Spirit Guides. This practice is not merely a technique but a dance of
      trust and connection, a blending energies that allows the spirit world to
      work through Tiago to bring forth healing that touches the deepest parts
      of your being.





      **A Unique Connection with the Spirit World**





      Through years of devotion, Tiago has cultivated a special relationship with spirit controls—those benevolent guides who assist him in this work. This bond allows for a sharper, more precise flow of healing power, tailored to your unique needs. Whether wounds are of the body, heart, mind, or spirit, the energy flows where it is most needed, guided by a wisdom far greater than Tiago's own.

      One of the gifts of Trance Healing is it’s gentle, non-intrusive nature.
      You need not speak of your medical conditions or the reasons you seek
      healing, though in this healing, Tiago hold space for sharing if you feel
      called to do so. The energy listens to the silent language of your soul,
      finding its way to where it can serve you best. After the session, if you
      wish to share it discuss your experience, he is here to listen with open
      heart-but the choice is always yours.





      **A Space of Possibility, Not Promises** 


      Many have found solace, transformation, and renewal through Trance Healing in this session, yet Tiago humbly acknowledge that each journey is unique. While the spiritual world offers boundless love and possibility, he make no promises of specific outcomes. This practice is a companion to your well-being, not a replacement for professional medical care, and he always encourage you to seek medical advice when needed.

      In this healing, a sanctuary of peace and support is created. Trance
      Healing blends beautifully with the collective energy generated
      together—through shared intentions, breaths, and open hearts. Tiago
      invites everyone to simply be present, feel the connection with those
      around them, and open their hearts to the infinite love that surrounds
      them. The energies of the spirit world flow through attendees, uplifting
      and restoring them in ways that words cannot fully capture.


      **Let us Begin**


      As preparation to step into this sacred space begins, Tiago asks everyone to close their eyes and let go of any burdens they may carry. Trust in the unseen, trust in the process, and trust in the loving support of the circle. Together, all are welcomed into the presence of the spirit world to embrace the great energy of spiritual healing that awaits.





      With all my love and gratitude,  


      Tiago Araújo
