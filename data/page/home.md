      name: What is Trance Healing?
    text: "Trance Healing is a gentle and non-intrusive spiritual practice with
      roots in ancient traditions and mediumship. During a session, Tiago enters
      a trance state to become a bridge for the Divine Intelligence to enter and
      to guide the flow of energy to where you need it most: physical comfort,
      emotional peace, mental clarity, or spiritual renewal. It’s a holistic
      experience that can work on many levels at once and can be offered in
      person or at a distance and can be facilitated individually or in a group
      setting."

      The energy transcends space and time, reaching you in whichever way feels
      most comfortable and safe for your heart:


      • **In-person sessions** — We meet in a tranquil, sacred space. Shared physical presence allows the energy to unfold in a deeply embodied way, often bringing sensations of warmth and profound connection.


      • **Remote via video call** — We connect through Zoom or a similar platform. Even through the screen, the energy flows with the same power, guided by intention and the loving presence of Spiritual Guides.


      • **Remote healing (no call required)** — Simply rest in your own space at the agreed time. The energy finds its way naturally through your openness and permission. Many find this modality especially intimate and liberating.


      **Individual Sessions or Healing Circles**


      You may choose an individual session, with complete focus on your unique journey, or join a Healing Circle — a small sacred group (in-person or online) where shared intention amplifies the field of love and light. In either case, the energy arrives with precision and unconditional care.

    text: You don’t need to say why you’re here. The energy naturally finds its way
      to where your soul needs support. If you’d like to share your thoughts or
      feelings, Tiago is there to listen with kindness, but it’s entirely up to
      you. After the session, you’re welcome to talk if you wish, knowing this
      is a safe and caring space.

    text: "Tiago has spent years practicing a connection with his Spirit Guides, who
      guide this healing work with love and wisdom. In a session, he enters a
      trance state, allowing these guides to direct healing energy exactly where
      it’s needed: perhaps to ease your body, soothe your heart, clear your
      mind, or lift your spirit. Their gentle precision ensures the energy flows
      with care to you."

    text: Many people feel comfort, relaxation, or a fresh sense of balance after a
      session, though everyone’s experience is different. Tiago respects your
      unique journey and doesn’t promise specific outcomes. This practice is
      here to support your well-being, not to take the place of medical care. He
      encourages you to seek professional medical advice when needed, as Trance
      Healing is a complementary therapy, working alongside traditional
      healthcare.
