      **What is Trance Healing**


      Trance Healing is a profound and sacred practice, serving as a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms. In this space, Tiago enters an altered state of consciousness, surrendering as a vessel to channel healing energies from the Divine Intelligence through the guidance of Spirit Guides. This practice is not merely a technique but a dance of trust and connection, blending energies that allow the spirit world to work through Tiago to bring forth healing that touches the deepest parts of your being.


      **Unique Connection with the Spirit World**


      Through years of practice, Tiago has cultivated a special relationship with the healers in the spiritual world - the guides who assist him in this work. This bond enables a sharper, more precise flow of healing power, adapting to your unique needs. Whether wounds are of the body, heart, mind, or spirit, the energy flows where it is most needed, guided by a wisdom far greater than Tiago’s own.

      **No Words Needed, Only Presence**


      One of the gifts of Trance Healing is its gentle, non-intrusive nature. You need not speak of your medical conditions or the reasons you seek healing, though Tiago holds space for sharing if you feel called to do so. The energy listens to the silent language of your soul, finding its way to where it can serve you best. After the session, if you wish to share your experience, Tiago is there to listen with an open heart—but the choice is always yours.


      **A Space of Possibility, Not Promises** 


      Many have found solace, transformation, and renewal through Trance Healing with Tiago, yet he humbly acknowledges that each journey is unique. While the spiritual world offers boundless love and possibility, Tiago makes no promises of specific outcomes. This practice is a companion to your well-being, not a replacement for professional medical care, and he always encourages seeking medical advice when needed.

      **An Invitation to Receive**


      In this healing space, Tiago creates a sanctuary of peace and support. Trance Healing blends beautifully with the collective energy generated together—through shared intentions, breaths, and open hearts. Tiago invites everyone to simply be present, feel the connection with those around them, and open their hearts to the infinite love that surrounds them. The energies of the spirit world flow through you, uplifting you and restoring you in ways that words cannot fully capture.


      **Let Us Begin**


      As preparation to step into this sacred space begins, Tiago asks everyone to close their eyes and let go of any burdens they may carry. Trust in the unseen, trust in the process, and trust in the loving support of the healing. Together, all are welcomed into the presence of the spirit world to embrace the great energy of spiritual healing that awaits.


      With love and gratitude,  


      Tiago Araújo
