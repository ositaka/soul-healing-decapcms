      **Trance Healing with Tiago**


      Welcome to this warm, calming space where the physical and spiritual worlds come together to support your healing. In Trance Healing, I enter a gentle trance state and become a clear channel for Divine Intelligence, allowing energy to flow through and to nurture your body, mind, and soul.

      With an open heart, I invite you to step into this caring experience.

      \

      A gentle and non-intrusive spiritual practice with ancient roots in healing mediumship. During a session and through an alternate state of consciousness, Tiago enters into a trance state where he becomes a connector for the Divine Intelligence to guide the flow of energy to where is needed the most: physical comfort, emotional peace, mental clarity, or spiritual renewal. It’s a holistic experience that can work on many levels at once and can be offered in person or at a distance and can be facilitated individually or in a group setting.

      The healing energy transcends space and time, flowing naturally to you in
      whichever way best supports your openness and intention:


      • **In-person** — We meet in a shared physical space. The shared presence often allows the energy to be felt in a deeply embodied way—many experience warmth, tingling, or a profound sense of connection.


      • **At a Distance** — We connect through Zoom or a similar platform. The energy flows with the same strength and precision, guided by clear intention and the loving presence of Spiritual Guides.


      • **Absent (no call required)** — You simply rest quietly in your own space at the agreed time. The energy arrives gently through your permission and openness—many people find this option especially intimate and deeply restorative.


      **Individual Sessions or Healing Circles**


      You may choose a private individual session, where the entire focus is on your unique journey, or join a Healing Circle—a small, sacred group (in-person or online) where the shared intention amplifies the field of love and light. In every case, the energy is directed with precision and unconditional care.

    text: You don’t need to say why you’re here. The energy naturally finds its way
      to where your soul needs support. If you’d like to share your thoughts or
      feelings, Tiago is there to listen with kindness, but it’s entirely up to
      you. After the session, you’re welcome to talk if you wish, knowing this
      is a safe and caring space.

    text: "Tiago has spent years practicing a connection with his Spirit Guides, who
      guide this healing work with love and wisdom. In a session, he enters a
      trance state, allowing these guides to direct healing energy exactly where
      it’s needed: perhaps to ease your body, soothe your heart, clear your
      mind, or lift your spirit. Their gentle precision ensures the energy flows
      with care to you."

    text: Many people feel comfort, relaxation, or a fresh sense of balance after a
      session, though everyone’s experience is different. Tiago respects your
      unique journey and doesn’t promise specific outcomes. This practice is
      here to support your well-being, not to take the place of medical care. He
      encourages you to seek professional medical advice when needed, as Trance
      Healing is a complementary therapy, working alongside traditional
      healthcare.
